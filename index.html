    <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
      of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
      dough.The kipferl, the origin of croissant, can be dated back to at least
      the 13th century in Austria, and came in various shapes. Croissants are
      named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with
      butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a
      thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
      layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
